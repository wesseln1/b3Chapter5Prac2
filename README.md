```
mkdir -p ~/workspace/javascript/exercises/array-methods && cd $_
touch index.html
touch array-methods.js
```

## Requirements

### Copy the code below into a JavaScript file, and follow the instructions in the comments.

```
const planets = ["mercury", "venus", "earth", "mars", "jupiter", "saturn", "uranus", "neptune"]

/*
    Use the forEach method to add the name of each planet
    to a section element in your HTML with an id of "planets".
    Use string templates to construct the DOM elements.
*/
const planetEl = document.getElementById("planets")

/*
    Use the map method to create a new array where the
    first letter of each planet is capitalized. Use the
    `toUpperCase()` method on strings.

*/


/*
    Use the filter method to create a new array that
    contains planets with the letter 'e'. Use the `includes()`
    method on strings.
